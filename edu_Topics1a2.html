                    <div class="panel-body">When trying to figure out where to work the first thing that comes to mind is the personailties of the
                        pople that may work there. Everyone wants a team of co-workers that are nice,fun, and allow you to
                        succeed in your job without any distractions. Although one should consider the people that may work
                        at the institution DO NOT make that your MAIN FOCUS ! Everyone has different traits that make up
                        who they are, and if they let that effect how you work that also effects whether or not you will
                        still have a Job. The companies that hire poeple do not have time to baby you, and deal with issues
                        that occur on the job site. If one has a problem they are held accountable to fix it. If that approach
                        does not work then consider a job where there is little interaction with other employees. Futhermore,one
                        starts to question the type of boss they will receive. Asking questions such as, Will my boss be
                        strict? Will my boss be rude ? Would my boss allow me to have a flexible schedule ?</div>

                <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                    <div class="panel-body">Always pick a job that is a good fit for you. They're very, very different environments, and it's important
                        to decide which you'd thrive in. If you're more of an individual worker who likes structure and competition,
                        fit yourself into an institution that accommodates your needs. However, beware this goes for any
                        Job your'e looking for... not just for the exanple metioned.
                        <br>
                        <br> The physical location is also important to consider. A long commute from home or a lack of lunch
                        options may pull down your everyday attitude. Nothing is worse than going to a miserable work enivronment
                        every morning, then taken unhappiness home with you. In addition considering you'll be spending 40
                        hours a week (or more) in your work environment, it should be one that encourages callaboration.</div>

                    <div class="panel-body">Having a great benefits package is important for more than the obvious reasons. If the company offers
                        it's employees perks like health, dental, retirement, and flexible spending plans, it can mean they're
                        competitive and doing well finacially. However, some compaines don't offer any beneits only because
                        they're smaller. It could also imply that they're struggling as a company.
                        <br> Benefits may not be overly important to you, working for a company without beneifts is something
                        to consider. Say that you have an accident at the workplace that doesnt offer you health insurance,
                        you would have to come out of your pocket with money to pay for medical bills that are NOT Cheap!
