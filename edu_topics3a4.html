				made an impression based on how you're dressed... your first impresssion means a lot.

						<strong>Interview </strong>
					</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 text-left">
					<p class="mytext"> You have finally gotten this far and this is the most important part of all. How you present yourself in a interview
						determines whether or not you will be getting the job... so you must take this seriously !
						<br>
						<br>
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div1 class="panel-heading">Listed below will be rules to follow while in a interview</div1>
					<div class="panel-body">
						1. Maintain eye contact- Doing this shows that you're interested and listening to what is being said by the interviewer.
						It also shows that you have confidence in what you're dicussing also. <br>
						<br> 2. Sit up straight- Good posture is always good to have, it demonstrates you have a strong sense of self-esteem.
						You should NEVER be slouched down in the chair !!!! You must lift your chin and push your shoulders back against the
						chair; with your feet flat on the floor.<br> **You might also want to cross your legs**<br>
						<br> 3. Pause before you speak- Rushing a answer may lead to you not fully getting your point across ! When you're
						being asked a question you should take a minute to brainstorm in your head how you will answer. This will gaurantee
						that you answer the question more throughly and confidently. Avoid repeating the words "UMM" and "Like" these words
						justify that you do not understand what you are trying to say also shows you do not have a strong vocabulary.<br>
						<br> 4. Be prepared for general interview questions- Always be ready to answer any question that may be thrown at you.<br>
						<br> Interviewers love to ask questions such as...<br>
						<br> Tell me about yourself. What are your strengths?
						<r> What are your weaknesses?<br> Why do you want this job?<br> Where would you like to be in your career five years from
							now?
							<br> What's your ideal company?<br> What attracted you to this company?<br> Why should we hire you?<br> What did you
							like least about your last job?<br> When were you most satisfied in your job?<br> What can you do for us that other
							candidates can't?<br>
							<br> 5. Keep your answers clear and concise - Try not to drag your answers out a lot for questions. Many poeple tend
							to do this and the answer starts to slowly go away from the topic from which the question was asking. Keep it SHORT,
							SWEET, and to the POINT.<br>
							<br> 6. Get there early - You do not want to be the person that is running late for a interview. You will be automatically
							taking off the list for getting the job. If you're late for the interview that is disrespectful to the instution.
							It also lets the interview know that if you're late for the interview, you will also be late if you were hired. Take
							into consideration that this company has taking the time to have a person come sit with you and get to know you better
							and see if you're fit for the job... take advantage of thaty opporunity.
